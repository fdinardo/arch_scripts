##    UEDIT:
##    You can edit a command, if and only if it's in your 
##    PATH, or in your work dir, and it is a text file.
##    I use this script to modify my scripts that are in the path, without 
##    write the enteir path.

##    BASH-COMPLETION RULE:
##    This script has a bash-completion rule, it complete the argoument 
##	  searching in your PATH and in your work dir.
